# othello-ai-implementation
This is a Python implementation of an AI that plays Othello.

I take full ownership of player.py file and all code within it. 
Implementation of the game itself is not mine.

To play Othell against my implementation of the AI, run reversi_creator.py.
Choose "TimR" as one of the players and "Interactive" as the other.

If you are unfamiliar with the rules, visit https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversi
